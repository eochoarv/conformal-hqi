# Conformal Prediction for Uncertainty Quantification in Microplastic Spectral Matching
This repository provides an implentation of conformal prediction to help the microplastic community to have uncertainty quantification in their predictions.

## Getting Started

This package is self-contained and implemented in python.

Part of the code is a taken from https://github.com/aangelopoulos/conformal-prediction/tree/main


### Prerequisites

* python
* numpy
* scipy
* scikit-learn
* pandas

### Installing

```bash
git clone git@github.com:eochoarv/conformal-hqi.git
```

## Usage


### ST DQR

Please refer to [usage_example.ipynb](usage_example.ipynb) for basic usage. 
Numerical experiments can be found in [numerical_experiments.ipynb](numerical_experiments.ipynb).

## Reproducible Research

The code available under /reproducible_experiments/ in the repository replicates the experimental results in [1].
